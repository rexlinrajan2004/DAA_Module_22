# EX 4D DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING â€“ 4
## DATE:
## AIM:
To find the minimum number of operations to convert str1 to str2 using Naive recursive method.

## Algorithm
1. Read the input string s and create a 2D table dp of size len(s) x len(s), initialized with False.
2. Set dp[i][i] = True for all i, since each single character is a palindrome.
3. Initialize two variables: max_length = 1 and start = 0 to keep track of the longest palindromic substring found.
4. For each possible substring length l from 2 to len(s), iterate over all starting indices i and calculate end = i + l.
5. If s[i] == s[end-1] and either the length is 2 or the inner substring dp[i+1][end-2] is True, mark dp[i][end-1] = True, and if the new palindrome is longer, update start and max_length.
6.After all iterations, return the substring s[start : start + max_length] as the longest palindromic substring.

## Result:
Thus the program was executed successfully for finding edit distance between two strings.
